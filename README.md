# LoanBuddy App

## Project Description

*This project was created for the HerHackathon 2021 Deloitte Challenge, with the topic of How to match AI and inclusion. My team worked on biased datasets that show that women and minorities face more difficulties in getting a loan. We created a solution of a web application that offers free, unbiased loan prediction services. I developed the front-end part of the solution, a **multi-page react application** showing some of the planned features.*

### 1. Key features

- The **multi-page** web app is built with **React**, HTML and CSS
- The layout of the page uses **bootstrap**
- The user can fill out the **online form** to see if they are eligible for a loan without the current biased loan request process

### 2. Usage

- The website can **accessed** in any browser with an internet connection; no need to install anything
- The **Home** page would provide information about the benefit of using the calculator and the process of it
- The **Apply** page would contain a three-step verification form. After submitting the first step, the user would see if they are eligible for the loan, and they can provide more data
- On the **Contact** page, users could subscribe to the email list and get in touch with the LoanBuddy
